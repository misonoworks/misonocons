# Misonocons
Misonocons are modern, free-use icons for custom keyboard keycaps. The styling of these icons are inspired by [Biip's work on KAT Milkshake](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=102271.0), [Swishy's work on KAM 80's After Dark](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=104913.0), and [MiTo's Micons](https://mitormk.com/). 

These icons were designed as a free, more appealing alternative to the everpresent IBM Selectric icons commonly used on most current keycap sets.

There are two variants of these icons available-- thick and thin.

### Misonocons (Thick)

These thicker icons are meant to work with thicker fonts such as those used on [BobaSweatandTears's KAT Great Wave](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=110310.0)

Displayed in the render above are thick Misonocons paired with Open Gorton Bold on basic BoW and WoB KAT keycaps.

### Misonocons (Thin)

These thinner icons are meant to work with thinner fonts, and the line thickness was made with Open Gorton/Gorton Modified font (a stock font on Signature Plastics SA, DSA, and DSS keycaps) in mind. However, these will also work well alongside Cherry font on GMK and JTK keycaps.

Displayed in the render above are thin Misonocons paired with Open Gorton on basic BoW and WoB KAT keycaps.

Lame formal accreditation aside, I don't mind if you simply reference me in your IC or GB in a manner such as, "Thanks to Misonoworks for Misonocons," or really, in any other manner that at least ties these icons back to me. I'd really prefer you to credit me for these icons as they took a lot of work, but if you don't, I'm not going to come after you for it. We're all just trying to make stuff here, after all!
In addition to this, if you are getting molds made for these icons to be manufactured in a double-shot manner (whether by GMK, JTK, Signature Plastics, etc.), the molds should be made public. This is a project made for free the community- spread the love!

**TL;DR: I'd like users to tie my likeness to the presence of these icons, but I won't chase after you if you don't. Also be generous and let others use molds for Misonocons if you get them made.**
